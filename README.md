# How did I get my name?

My name was originally redgriefer89, based off the naming scheme seen in the League of Griefers Series by Winter Morgan because I'm uncreative when it comes to names. I can't remember if it's good or not, since I read it years ago. 

I then discovered A Steam discussion for A Hat in Time about eggs, so I replaced "griefer" with "egg" as a joke and it stuck. You can still see my old name in certain places and odds are that if there's a name that follows that same scheme, it's me.

Unrelated: The "89" was was (and still is) supposed to be pronounced eight-nine, not eighty-nine, but I won't get mad at you for either pronunciation.

# Do you/did you actually grief?

No. ~~But I can, for the right price~~

# What do you do?

I have the most experience with C#, followed by C, and despite my profile saying otherwise, I know nothing about ShaderLab or HLSL. I have a bit of experience in web design, but not much.

# If I need to tell you about a bug, where should I tell you?

File an issue and if it's really bad, shoot me a DM at redegg89#9290
