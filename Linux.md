Odds are you just asked me what linux is and you got sent this link. Put simply, Linux is a kernel, just like Windows's (Windows'? Idk) NT and Mac's XNU. Of course, there are others such as the BSD kernel, but that may make things more complicated. A kernel lies between your firmware (BIOS/UEFI) and programs. This means that if I said to you before that Linux was an operating system, I was lying for the sake of time. Linux is actually used in many operating systems called "distros," each with their own strong points and weaknesses. For instance, Debian is lacking the latest features, but your stuff is pretty much gauranteed to work if you got it working once. On the other hand, something like Arch is much more up to date, but everything rolls out independently, possibly leading to breakage. Another thing is security. Windows takes a more "security through obscurity" approach, where basically their kernel is secure because nobody can see the source code outside of Microsoft. In contrast, linux is open and [anyone can look at the source code.](https://kernel.org) Sure, this does give bad actors the ability to look at the code, but there can be as many as thousands of people looking at the code at any one time. Not to mention that if Linus or another person were to add telemetry or an NSA backdoor, someone could fork the code and remove it. [Actually, that same thing happened with Audacity.](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity) This open approach allows you to do more with you computer than ever before, including uninstalling the bootloader, init system, and GNU coreutils (all of which are essential to run your computer except the last one in certain circumstances). Linux is even versatile enough to run on a payment processor or even a literal toaster! There are many stories of linux breathing new life into old hardware that'd otherwise be obsolete. You yourself even use linux if you use a chromebook (Not too sure how this helps my point that you should switch with how locked-down ChromeOS is, but figured I'd include it, since you've probably used a chromebook before). Most games even run perfectly fine through linux with stuff like Valve's Proton and Wine, which is what Proton is based off of. There's even some dumb stuff you can't do in Windows that's a simple right-click or config file change away (I'm looking at you, putting windows always on top).

Recommendation for newbies (From Windows)

### [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org)
- Dr460nized/dragonized gaming
- Yeah that installs pretty much everything you might need right away

Recommendation for low-end hardware (Like I mean really low end)

### [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org)
- XFCE
- OpenRC
- Custom-compiled kernel that only has necessities
- Replace GNU Coreutils with Busybox

Actually Sensible, programs for gaming/stuff I use included in list

### [Artix Linux](https//:artixlinux.org)
Pretty much necessary if not familiar with terminal emulator

- KDE Plasma/XFCE

Stuff for gaming/streaming/chatting
